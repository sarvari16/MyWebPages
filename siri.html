            My name is <span class="important-word">Sarvari</span>, and I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in the Internet of Things (IoT) department as a 4th-semester student. My register number is <span class="highlight">23BCT0048</span>. With a passion for technology and innovation, I strive to excel in both academic and extracurricular activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the IoT department, I have a keen interest in learning about connected devices, cloud computing, and data analytics. I enjoy exploring how IoT can solve real-world challenges and transform industries. Working on collaborative projects has honed my <span class="strong-word">teamwork</span> and <span class="emphasized-word">critical thinking</span> skills, enabling me to approach problems from different perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I actively participate in hackathons and workshops to enhance my technical knowledge and network with like-minded individuals. I believe that staying curious and adaptable is essential in the rapidly evolving field of IoT. My ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech ecosystem and leave a lasting impact through innovative solutions.
